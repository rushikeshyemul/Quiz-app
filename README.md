- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **React Router** for navigation
- **Lucide React** for icons

### Backend
- **Node.js** with Express
- **MongoDB** with Mongoose
- **JWT** for authentication
- **bcryptjs** for password hashing

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- MongoDB database
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd quiz-app
   ```

2. **Install frontend dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install backend dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Environment Setup**
   
   **Backend Setup:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node setup-env.js
   ```
   This creates a `.env` file with local MongoDB configuration.
   
   **Frontend Setup:**
   ```bash
   node setup-env.js
   ```
   This creates a `.env` file for the frontend. The app works with mock data by default, but you can optionally:
   - Get a free API key from [Together AI](https://together.ai)
   - Replace `your_together_api_key_here` with your actual API key for AI-powered quiz generation

### Vite Proxy Configuration

The project uses a Vite proxy to forward all `/api` requests from the frontend to the backend server during development.  
**No changes are needed if you use the provided `vite.config.ts`.**  
If you modify backend ports, update the `server.proxy` section in `vite.config.ts` accordingly:

```js
server: {
  proxy: {
    '/api': 'http://localhost:5000', // Change 5000 if your backend uses a different port
  },
},
```

**After changing the Vite config, always restart the frontend dev server.**

5. **Start the backend server**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Start the frontend development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

7. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## Troubleshooting

### MongoDB Connection Issues
If you encounter MongoDB connection errors:

1. **Install MongoDB locally**:
   ```bash
   # On Windows (using Chocolatey)
   choco install mongodb
   
   # On macOS (using Homebrew)
   brew install mongodb-community
   
   # On Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt-get install mongodb
   ```

2. **Start MongoDB service**:
   ```bash
   # Windows
   net start MongoDB
   
   # macOS/Linux
   sudo systemctl start mongod
   ```

3. **Alternative: Use MongoDB Atlas**:
   - Create a free account at [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas)
   - Create a cluster and get your connection string
   - Update the `MONGO_URI` in your backend `.env` file

4. **Test the connection**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run test-data
   ```

### Frontend Issues
- Clear browser cache and local storage
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure both frontend and backend are running

### Testing the Quiz Attempt Fix
1. **Start the backend server**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Start the frontend**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test the backend API**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run test-backend
   ```

4. **Take a quiz and check the dashboard**:
   - Log in to the application
   - Take a quiz
   - Click on your username to access the user dashboard
   - Check browser console for debugging information

5. **If issues persist**:
   - Check browser console for error messages
   - Verify MongoDB is running: `mongod`
   - Check backend console for connection errors

#### MongoDB Atlas EREFUSED Error

If you see an error like `MongoDB connection error: Error: querySrv EREFUSED ...`:

- Make sure your internet connection is active.
- Go to your MongoDB Atlas dashboard, and under **Network Access**, add your current IP address or use `0.0.0.0/0` for open access (less secure).
- Double-check your connection string in the backend `.env` file.
- Restart your backend server after making changes.
